1. Strategy Pattern is shown under the 'Strategy' package. Defined the strategy pattern in the Adventurer class; with the expertise starting from the novice level.
2. Observer Pattern is shown under the 'Observer' package. For the Observer pattern, we are using the 'Push' Model, i.e the subject sends the message to the Logger and the Tracker and both of these are not allowed to query the subject for more information. 
3. Decorator Pattern is shown under the 'Decorator' package. For the decorator, as described in the Assignment description, we have defined a Treasure_Bag which is defined as a member variable of the Adventurer class and used to calculate the total amount of treasure held by an adventurer.
